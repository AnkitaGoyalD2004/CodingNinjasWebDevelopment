            Don't &nbsp you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user interface? While most of us
            would
            reply with an assertive "YES" little,
            do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into making a website attractive and user-friendly. The
            secret
            to creating an impressive site is
            to master the art of front-end development, and no, it is not as easy as it seems!
            <br>
            However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that will help you get better in front-end design
            and
            web development.

                <h4>Commenting </h4>
            </li>
            <p>
                Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are
                written
                by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of project you create. With
                proper
                comments and organised files its always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where things
                are
                at and how they work.
            </p>

                <h4>Invest In Productive Tools.</h4>
            </li>
            <p id="para">
                The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from browser add-ons to smart plugins, the
                amount of choices available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really productive web tools
                that’ll
                help you improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, Bootstrap, and
                Sass are nothing short of a godsend for web developers.

                <h4>Always Be Curious.</h4>
            </li>
            <p>
                A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news and
                innovations
                in the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about front-end development from
                informative blogs and videos. Following are some of the most informative and useful learning sources for
                front-end developers -

                <h4>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.</h4>
            </li>
            <p>
                By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its functionality.
                This will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it,
                your code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of what it was before. Apart
                from that,
                one of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code remains free
                from plagiarism.
            </p>
            <li>
                <h4> Automate! </h4>
                <p>
                    As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute little details that can get
                    overwhelming at times. You have to invest your time on things like Boilerplate, testing, workflow,
                    dependency management, performance, optimization, build, deployment, and so on. Doesn’t sound easy,
                    right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your workflow. While automation can
                    take care of things such as optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas of
                    front-end development such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side software, enhancing the
                    user-experience, and so on. By doing so, not only will your productivity increase, but you will also
                    learn to use your time to focus on the areas that’ll improve the overall functionality of your site.
                    Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very efficient automation tools.

            While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end designer, in the long run, you must always
            remember two things while designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget to create your
            signature style. And for all you peeps interested in making it big in front-end development.
